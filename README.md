### GROUP PROJECT 5

To classify whether forests in South America (?) is growing or shrinking. 
We will be analyzing data sets to find out what contributes to deforestation or growth.
Using Machine learning, we can then predict whether the forest for each country (?) will be classified as growing or not.  We are planning on using a combination of clustering and Regression analysis. 
To visualize, we will use Tableau to plot the graphs of the scale of the forests.

We will utilize the following data sets:


* We got our data sets for forest data per country in South America used to represetn and graph current forest condtions. 
*Carmen [datarepository.movebank.org](https://www.datarepository.movebank.org/handle/10255/move.837)
*Kate[ourworldindata.org]( https://ourworldindata.org/forest-area#how-much-of-the-earth-s-surface-is-forested).

* We found and downloaded the data for deforestation factors, this gives a good generilztion of deforestaion:
*Jade cleaned and worked on: [kaggle.com]( https://www.kaggle.com/chiticariucristian/deforestation-and-forest-loss).


### Objective

After assembling the dataset, we will be using pandas and pycaret to create cluster and regrston analysis of the amzon rainforest per a country. We will create a prediction model to predict the rainforest size per a country in South America.

* We will use the the Brazil data set to train a logistic model: * http://terrabrasilis.dpi.inpe.br/app/map/deforestation?hl=pt-br
* We will use  * https://www.kaggle.com/balraj98/deepglobe-land-cover-classification-dataset?select=test to train data to underatnad mapping data. We plan to build our own image libary of past 20 years of satalite images of the Amazon to create a cluster model. * https://eos.com/blog/free-satellite-imagery-sources/ 

We will then create a dashboard page with a dropdown menu that will allow for a user to select which Country they want to investigate. We will also use Tableau to make map visulizations. 
These visualiztions will show past current and predicted future forest inforamtion. We plan to map and graph these.
