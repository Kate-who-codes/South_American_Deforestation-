# South_American_Deforestation-
Final Project for UC Davis Boot Camp 2021

GROUP PROJECT 5
Deforestation:
To classify whether forests in South America (?) is growing or shrinking. 
We will be analzying data sets to find out what contributes to deforestation or growth.
Using ML, we can then predict whether the forest for each country (?) will be classified as growing or not. 
To visualize, we will use Tableau or Map (in D3?) to plot the graphs of the scale of the forests.
